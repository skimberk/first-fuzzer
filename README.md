## Useful work

Generating code from ANTLR v4 grammars:
https://github.com/renatahodovan/grammarinator
(and the accompanying paper, "Grammarinator: A Grammar-Based Open Source Fuzzer", although it doesn't provide much insight)

Generate code and mutate test cases (precedes grammarinator):
"Fuzzing with Code Fragments" resulting in LangFuzz, however not open source.

Generating code from grammars very quickly:
"Building Fast Fuzzers" resulting in F1 fuzzer, however not very useful. Not many options, unclear whether being fast is useful for us.
